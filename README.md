Repository organization:
---
The Scenarios folder contains the individual Greenfoot scenarios for ZombieLand in numbered subfolders. 

Each scenario is wrapped in a Greenfoot package in the Packages Folder.

The ZombieLand folder is a base scenario that all of the individual ZombieLand scenarios are built from.

The WorldBuilder folder contains a Greenfoot scenario that functions as a level editor for the ZombieLand scenarios.

ZombieLandPackager is a manager for the scenarios, allowing scenarios to be built into Greenfoot packages
